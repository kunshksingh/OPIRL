# OPIRL
Welcome to One Piece In Real Life! OPIRL is a project in order to bring the One Piece devil fruit power system to life, so anyone can enjoy stretching their arms with the Gomu Gomu No Mi in AR! 

OPIRL is built using Unity3D for HoloLens2. Since HoloLens2 is Microsoft based, only Windows currently supported.
OPIRL uses MRTK 2.8.0.0 and FMOD 2.02.07.

How to install OPIRL onto HoloLens:
*Step 1: Download latest build of OPIRL onto a Windows computer/laptop
*Step 2: Physically connect your Hololens2 using USB-C port
*Step 3: Extract build (if zipped) and open OPIRL.sln
*Step 4: Change architecture to "ARM" and build destination to "Device" 
*Step 5: Hit the green play button
*Step 6: Once the download finishes, go to "All Apps" and search for OPIRL
*Step 7: Enjoy :)
